# cryptoIO
- The goal of the "cryptoIO" cryptography package is to offer a straightforward yet effective tool for safely encrypting and decrypting data. 

- It provides a variety of encryption methods, such as the contemporary Diffie-Hellman key exchange technique for safe key creation and distribution,
  the traditional Caesar cipher, and a block cipher for stronger encryption.

- After entering their secret messages and selecting an encryption method, users can have the application encrypt them and store them in a file.
- After that, recipients can use the application and the relevant key to decrypt the communications.

- The course encourages students to learn about and investigate concepts related to cryptography, including key exchange, symmetric and asymmetric encryption,and cryptographic algorithms.
- It can be applied to secure communication requirements where privacy is crucial or to educational objectives.
